%The goal of this script is to ensure that the effective 4-outcome, 4-input
%POVM perfomed by B and C after the isometric channel cannot lead to Bell
%nonlocality. For this goal, we show that this set of effective POVMs with
%the state from our experiment is unsteerable. We also show that the white
%noisy robustness of this effective POVM is 0.7746, hence considerably
%grater than p_Designolle = 0.6875, the visibility for which the two-qubit
%Werner state is ensure to be Bell local.
